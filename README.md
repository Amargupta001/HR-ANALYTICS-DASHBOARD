# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD

 Excited to share one more project “HR Analytics Dashboard” using #powerbi ! 📊

I recently completed a project where I leveraged the power of #dataanalysis and #visualization to provide data-driven #insights for improving employee performance and reducing #attrition.
 
🔸 OBJECTIVE :-
 
Help an organization to improve employee performance and improve employee retention (reduce attrition) by creating a HR Analytics Dashboard.

☑ #dataloading : The transformed data was loaded into Power View for further analysis.
☑ #datamodelling : Created a logical structure of data through data modelling process, enabled effective analysis and visualization.
☑ #daximplementation : Refined the data using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated measures and columns for advanced analysis.
